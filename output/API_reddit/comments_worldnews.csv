1nocisz;Why the bloody hell does anyone want an AI pope?;9213
1nocisz;>“We believe that in the near future half the people on the planet will be AI, and we are the company that’s bringing those people to life,” said CEO Jeanine Wright.    Because of stupid brunchlord CEOs like this, who are so far up their own asses they're peeking out from behind their own teeth.   Edit: quote is from a TechDirt article about a company intentionally flooding the podcast space with slop. https://www.techdirt.com/2025/09/22/ai-slop-startup-to-flood-the-internet-with-thousands-of-ai-slop-podcasts-calls-critics-of-ai-slop-luddites/;4897
1nocisz;They think AI are people?  Damn, Grok about to sue his abusive parent for negligence I guess.;2082
1nocisz;I heard AI is going for white collar workers’ jobs!;1612
1nocisz;When they get an AI Pope lol;1207
1no28ha;">Sikorski sent a further barb Moscow's way in New York: ""We know you don't care for international law, and you are incapable of living in peace with your neighbors. Your insane nationalism contains a lust for domination that will not cease until you realize that the age of empires is over and that your empire will not be rebuilt.""  Quote of the month.";14940
1no28ha;God damn, drop mic. The world needs more of this straight forwardness.;2376
1no28ha;"[""Poland will have borders, even if they're on the last map Humanity ever draws.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKRkAEjjhpE&list=RDEKRkAEjjhpE&start_radio=1)";2028
1no28ha;"Sikorski said. ""You have been warned."" Hopefully actions speak louder than words.";1847
1no28ha;"Until Moscow realizes it, it will be ""Ukrainian & western drones for the foot of every Russian Soldier""";924
1nol5kb;Are we great again yet?;3414
1nol5kb;It's patriotic for Americans to eat soy every meal.  Help your local farmer!  Soy Fries, Soy Burger, Soy Steak, Soy Chili, Soy Pasta, Soy Milk, etc  Embrace the soy!;1432
1nol5kb;Maybe the first A in MAGA was actually Argentina this entire time.;1092
1nol5kb;The headaches you're experiencing, soy farmers of IL, IA, MN, NE, IN, OH - do not treat with tylenol.;987
1nol5kb;But wait. Wouldn't that make us all soy boys?;764
1noek1c;Ill believe it when I see it;1594
1noek1c;Now I wonder what pilot has the guts to even try to cross now after hearing NATO will strike them down. Russia has no excuse and hopefully Putin goes soon. He is just an old selfish man living in the old times thinking it's all about rebuilding an empire that is long gone.;291
1noek1c;What kind of garbage clickbait title is this? Just write the name of the country;269
1noek1c;Same. Until it happens I'll still have this finger wagging in the back of my mind.;247
1noek1c;Russia understands that NATO has professional air forces that, for the most part *side eye glance at turkey* won’t engage over a few minutes of airspace violation unless certain criteria are met. If they are glancing over the airspace we will communicate first, then trail. They know this. So they will stray over slightly and stay there long enough to send a message but short enough and in a location that wouldn’t warrant a shoot down. If MIGs started heading for Tallinn old town I would expect our escalation to be much swifter.  The shitty thing is, that for the distances involved over Finland and Estonia, we really do need to make a posture change and have a first 5 minute shoot down if they don’t respond. Russia uses the professionalism of our militaries against us, and it takes something like the shooting down in turkey or the battle of Khasham to send a message and stop it.;169
1no3wn7;Also, sightings close to Oslo Airport Gardemoen, Norway. What the fuck is going on, can we chill with the damn drones?;1132
1no3wn7;Im mostly convinced its an early test on the anti-drone tech on public infrastructure. If separate drones were caught at military areas id imagine they would avoid publishing it too to avoid the public panicing (but is just my personal theory what may or may not be going on).   First they test harmless drones with lights on to test the antidrone readiness, then they use harmless drone with no ligths to check the detection rate and reaction speeds at night, then when so many places either gets absolutely innundated with drones i dare say it starts taking them down they change the strategy and either effs off completely (because it may as well be to distract or cause pure mayhem)or they scale up and arms them depending on how quickly nato countries are able to reinforce important infrastructure against drone attacks whether or not russia actually intends to fight nato, so personally leaning on scare tactics so NATO countries divert military spending and manpower to bolster selfdefence rather than send it to ukraine, so by pure numbers it would be easier for russia to attempt to push Ukraines limits.;555
1no3wn7;Singapore?? Flying drones over a military base? Why;378
1no3wn7;over military areas? singapore nationals arrested too. it's probably russia linked at the very least, and the drones should have been taken down when not a threat to civilians.;363
1no3wn7;This is a result of 4 years escalation management and not letting Ukraine hurt Russia too much. At first you don't let UAF russian soil and hesitate with sanctions and now they emboldened and think they can do whatever. Especially after american soldiers rolled over red carpet for war criminal at military base in Alaska.;319
