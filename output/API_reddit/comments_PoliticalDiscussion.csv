1nnuiew;Feels like this is a question not really seeking an answer. RFK Jr. is a conspiracy theorist, and he does not care about the science, and Trump doesn’t care enough about any of this to step in and stop him.;309

1nnuiew;Because HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy's agenda has nothing to do with science, facts, or protecting the health of the American people.  Why else would a claim that's been repeatedly proven false for years be being championed?;1
1nnuiew;So this is only tangentially related but I suspect it can answer your question.  Google Alexander Avila, he just put out an hour long youtube video about the MAHA movement.  In particular about a pair of siblings who seem to have come out of no where and are now top advisors to RFK jr.  His conclusion is that their goal is to gut HHS and instead route all the money spent into health savings accounts.  While also removing any restrictions on what counts as appropriate spending for HSAs.  Guess who conviently runs a company that helps expensive 'wellness' brands qualify to sell their product to HSAs?;1
1nnuiew;Because America is over. Literally. The Supreme Court just ruled, by turning over a 95-year-old precedent, that the president can fire anybody in the executive branch he wants to. One singular person top down rule. That’s democracy right? America is an oligarchy. It’s corrupt, it’s done.;1
1nkeu1q;They’re using the death of a free speech absolutist to justify punishing private citizens and corporations for constitutionally protected speech.   “Never waste the opportunity offered by a good crisis.” - Machiavelli;327
1nkeu1q;As some have noted, Kirk is Horst Wessel.  A martyr for the cause.  (They were working on turning Ashli Babbitt into Wessel, and then this happened.)  What the Dems should be doing is turning this into their own QAnon.  All Nick Fuentes, all the time.  Fuentes had already said on video that he had infiltrated Kirk's organization and was coming after him, so it's perfect.  Conspiracy theories are fun, regardless of whether they are accurate.  Trump tried to create his Reichstag fire with the LA demonstrations.  It failed.    As it turns out, the military and National Guard are not particularly eager to be involved, as we can see now in DC with the Guard members posing in tourist photos and picking up trash instead of shooting people as Trump would have hoped.;164
1nkeu1q;"I hate to say it, but certain factions of this country are too stupid to understand the complexities of every situation.  I see Kimmel's firing being brushed off because Tucker Carlson was let go by FOX. ""Well both got fired, so both got cancelled!"" Not realizing that the federal government had nothing to do with FOX terminating Tucker Carlson.  What's worse is that some people know the difference, but will cheer for Kimmel's firing anyway because they never cared about free speech/government censorship. How do I describe the morality of these people? Can anyone help me?";121
1nkeu1q;...can we really say this was for non-political reasons, though?;68
1nkeu1q;"And Tucker came out against this specifically saying :  ""You hope a year from now, the turmoil we're seeing in the aftermath of his murder won't be leveraged to bring hate speech laws to this country.  ""And trust me...if that does happen, there is never a more justified moment for civil disobedience than that—ever, and there never will be. Because if they can tell you what to say, they're telling you what to think, there is nothing they can't do to you because they don't consider you human. They don't believe you have a soul.""";58
1nn6k1v;The government is making money off the tariffs, yes that's true.  Is that helping the average consumer, not one bit .   See trump doesn't understand that companies are  passing off the cost of duties to consumers via price hikes.   Also companies are having to lay off employees due to these increased duties , in some cases to prevent price hikes.   Trump also doesn't understand that small businesses can't just pickup and move supply chains to the US, due to lack of work force and factories here   Trump is gaslighting the public and hoping that they don't vote with their wallet , unlike the last election. He is in denial of the burden he's put on consumers.;759
1nn6k1v;Other countries do not pay the tariffs, period.  We pay the tariffs in the form of increased prices because the importers pay the tariffs and raise their prices accordingly.  Trump is a pathological liar supported by low information cult members;482
1nn6k1v;The tariff income goes into the general fund of the US Treasury. It’s spent through the budget process. The budget, as established in the “Big Beautiful Bill” is heavily weighted toward tax reduction for the very wealthy, reduces healthcare for millions and overspends income by about 4 trillion dollars. The tariffs make a minor contribution to the budget. The national debt increases by 4 trillion in spite of the tariffs. Effectively, the government borrows to cover tax cuts. The majority of the tariffs will be paid by US consumers and US companies. The companies will gradually raise prices to assure the majority of the cost will be passed on to consumers. We are all being screwed in the process.;376
1nn6k1v;Consumers are paying more money so the wealthy can hoard more wealth.;226
1nn6k1v;It is an additional sales tax no matter how much he tries to call it a tariff. Like all sales taxes it's a regressive tax that hurts the lowest income population the hardest.;129

1nnpbbf;American Jews as a demographic are mostly Ashkenazim, meaning their families came to the US from Eastern European countries. Jews in America have largely been a part of the Democratic coalition since the New Deal. Prominent left-wing Israeli politicians like Ben Gurion and Golda Meir were also Ashkenazi and coming from socialist countries in the USSR may have influenced that. American Jews are also highly educated (which correlates with voting left-wing in the US) and are concentrated in states like blue states like New York, Illinois, and California, and purple states like Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Florida.  The majority of Israeli Jews are Mizrahi, which means their family came to Israel from Middle Eastern/Arab countries (or have lived in Israel for several generations). These voters, who experienced living in Arab countries are much more security minded and have experienced/heard stories of the persecution of Jews in Arab lands. One of the reasons that Israel went from having socialist leadership early on like Ben Gurion and Golda Meir, to conservative leadership like Sharon and Netanyahu is that Israel's early immigrants were Ashkenazi and over decades the country grew from Jewish immigrants being kicked out of Muslim countries like Yemen, Iraq, Morroco and migrating to Israel.  Trump is popular in Israel because he is viewed as being unapologetically pro-Israel and pro-Israeli security. He recognized Israeli annexation of the Golan, moved the US embassy to Jerusalem (de-facto recognizing it as Israel's capitol), and has been supportive of the war against Hamas in Gaza (for example Trump negotiated directly with Hamas on the release of an American Israeli captive Edan Alexander). Jews in Israel, receive the benefits of Trump's foreign policy without having to endure his Domestic policy. American Jews are socially liberal, and while many are supportive of Israel, they are more affected by Domestic US policy and vote left for social/economic reasons (abortion is overwhelmingly accepted in Judaism for example).;1
1nnpbbf;1. Israel is a far-right society radicalized by decades of conflict. The Jews there grow up in that environment. The Jews here don't, if anything they grow up in very much the opposite of that environment here: peaceful progressive diverse cities like NYC. They haven't grown up in perpetual conflict. A demagogue like Trump is perfect for a country like Israel, Bibi himself is like an Israeli Trump.  2. American Jews can smell the Republican antisemitism from like a mile away. Israeli Jews live in a majority Jewish country where parties across the spectrum are dominated by Jews, they don't really have an issue with antisemitism in their politics, so they can vote as far-right as they want without having to fear antisemitism.;1
1nnpbbf;I think it should be mentioned the out sized political power Orthodox Jews world in Israel compared to elsewhere. They are very populous and yet don't have to serve in the military, afaik. They are in general much more in favor of military action than their Israeli counterparts, and yet have no stake in the game.;1
1nnpbbf;"The American Evangelican Christian Right has promoted Israel since the 1970s. The Modern Evangelical Movement is highly Millennialist meaning that its very apocalyptic in a very immediate sense. This strain of Christianity stresses that the end times are going to happen any time now, or that they've already begun and we are now living through their opening stages. This idea creates an immediacy to their faith, that they must get right with God right now *or else.* In their interpretation of the End Times Israel is central to everything that will signal the Anti-Christ and the 1000 years of darkness will occur! In the Jewish Bible *Israel* refers to the Jewish People in covenant with their God, and in the New Testament it refers to the People of God which is anyone who's Christian who's soul is saved. The Evangelical Right has identified the State of Israel, which identifies itself as the nation of the Jewish People, as being their biblical Israel.   So in a case of strange bed fellows many Evangelical Americans pushed for the US Government to become much more Pro-Israel and much more pro-active in supplying them weapons and regional support. They pushed really hard for about a decade for an American presidential candidate who was openly Pro-Christianity, Pro-""Family Values"", and importantly Pro-Israel. Haaaaaaaaaaaaave you met Ronald Reagan? The Reagan Administration leapt into partnering with Israel, even overlooking cases of Israeli espionage and industrial spying, treating it like another front in the global Cold War.   Donald Trump is the inheritor of the American Political Right's need to promote Israel for their End of Days prophecies to come true. The Evangelical Right was an early and enthusiastic adopter of Donald J Trump because he made early and enthusiastic overtures to their leaders, who promoted him as The Man who was going to save the soul of America, right all of the wrongs, and who would stand up for their brand of Christianity in a forceful and open manner. I doubt Trump himself, as a private individual, has much regard or interest in Israel. He's reportedly called Jewish People who've worked for him (or who he's butted heads with) some remarkably un-politically correct nick names. Before his Presidency he had no great affinity with the Jewish community of New York as far as I can tell.   But if he's to be the Defender of the Evangelical Christian Right and its cause, then promoting Israel and protecting it is of course what he's always been in favor of!";1
1nl6nez;"They're comedians... they're not required to be ""accurate"", or polite for that matter.    Lemme know when they fire Brian Killmeade for calling for killing off the homeless.    Or for that matter when they're gonna fire the entire Fox News staff for all the various lies they've spread over the years.";385
1nl6nez;">the Jimmy Kimmel case, Kimmel appears to have screwed up by mis-characterizing (from what little I have been able to understand) the motivations of the Charlie Kirk assassin   He didn't ""screw up"" , he said what was thought at the time   Using the same standards, Kirk continued to spread lies about the man who beat Paul Pelosi *after they were disproven*. Somehow, the FCC chair at the time magically refrained from getting involved    Trump is a thin skinned baby and has filled his Administration with more of the same.   As for the FCC in general, their ability to have any influence on content should be wound down.. as should broadcast television in general. Set a 40 year sunset period and reclaim the spectrum for better use";123
1nl6nez;He didn’t even comment on the killer’s motive himself. He only said that conservatives were trying to characterize him as anything except one of them. Which was/is true. Jimmy didn’t say one way or the other anything about who the killer was.;64
1nl6nez;It's just proves what I've been saying for years: these guys don't care about free speech. Never have. They were just mad that they experienced consequences for their actions. Now that the shoe's on the other foot, they're just as gleefully censorious as their puritan ancestors making a woman sew a red A to her dress.;52
1nl6nez;We are in a full fascist meltdown. I think a part of America died when an FCC official bullied a network into firing someone they disagreed with politically.  That is what happens in dictatorships and banana republics, not the greatest democracy the world has ever known.  I feel anger, shock, disbelief and betrayal. And I can't even trust my neighbors anymore. Everyone has gone stark raving mad and will do anything Trump says and defend him no matter what.  It is truly a cult.;51
