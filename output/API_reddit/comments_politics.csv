1nok4av;It was pretty rough, pretty clear the US isn't fielding its best and brightest on the international stage.  You don't win medals by losing, donald.;1
1nok4av;He sounded like a dim, opinionated drunk, making up facts and figures through a wash of bluster.;1
1nok4av;Honestly never thought I'd live to see the day that America became such an international embarrassment.;1
1nok4av;As [Donald Trump](https://inews.co.uk/topic/donald-trump?ico=in-line_link) hailed “the golden age of America” at the UN General Assembly in New York on Tuesday, tensions between the US and United Nations were palpable.  [The President](https://inews.co.uk/news/science/what-science-says-autism-why-trump-wrong-3932354?ico=in-line_link) highlighted “historic trade deals” with the UK and others, and claimed the US was respected “like it has never been respected before” – but the response was embarrassing.  There was [scattered awkward laughter in the room](https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/uk-politics-latest-updates-live-5-3930091?ico=in-line_link) as he jokingly complained about a broken escalator and teleprompter at the UN – and a lack of marble floors. UN officials and experts have warned that Trump’s combative approach to the organisation could lead to a waning of US influence.  Since the start of the year, Trump has moved to slash US funding of the UN, withdrawn from many of its agencies, and ordered a review of America’s interactions with the organisation.  His actions have exacerbated the UN’s already significant budget crisis and created space for nations including China to expand their influence.  “US credibility and influence as a reliable partner and as a state broadly committed to human rights and international peace and security is suffering badly,” Phil Lynch, executive director of the non-profit International Service for Human Rights, told *The i Paper*.  “Trump on the international level has an agenda which very much mirrors his agenda at the domestic level, which is one of the suppression of dissent, the erosion of accountability mechanisms and the subversion of the rule of law.  “His agenda at the UN in terms of the withdrawal of funding and denunciation of treaties follows a very similar pattern.”;1

1noqbhr;Currently, /r/ Conservative is still on Charlie Kirk and is posting articles about how how his death is leading to 'way more Republican registrations' on top of degenerate 4Chan memes, as well as bizarre statements about how they're 'done talking to liberals.';1
1noqbhr;You'll notice how no one ever quotes the dude...;1
1noqbhr;"Republicans refuse to believe the reality that he was a piece of shit and that liberals aren't going out and shooting up places, so they replaced it with their own narrative so they don't have to answer the ""are we the baddies"" question?   Notably, I don't see anyone getting raptured today, so that speaks loads about them now doesn't it?";1

1nofipg;Hell hath no fury like Nintendos legal team;3977
1nofipg;I know they’re trying to be funny, but this is another way to try and dehumanize people. People aren’t Pokémon. You’re separating families, and there’s a good chance they’ll never see their kids or spouse again. You’re taking them to countries they’ve never been to before. You’re even taking them countries that are having civil unrest where they could easily get killed. This is not a game.   Republican extremists try to be funny, and they’re not. They’re bullies and disguising it as humor.;1189
1nofipg;Tell Nintendo that DHS wants to host a Smash tournament.  That'll get them involved.;1000
1nofipg;They are notoriously litigious and protective of their IPs.;885
1nofipg;Nintendo would sue Jesus Christ himself for less, give me a fucking break lol;401

1noifii;Because Trump wants to shut down the government.  He wants to blame it on the Democrats.  He wants to declare it a national emergency and with that declaration cut the Congress out of the budget process (which is of course illegal, but this SCOTUS will sign off on it).;1
1noifii;With every day that passes, more professionalism is gone.  I struggle to imagine a path where we get to a place that the country is ever run professionally and politically anymore. Backed by the legal system, the constitution, and science.  It's really sad.;1

1nonj9g;She's one of the few (or the only) standard bearers for decency in all this. Condemning political violence does not mean you should honor the hateful, bigoted, anti-democratic views of someone who had, in his turn, celebrated political violence.;1
1nonj9g;Thank you AOC! Also, some words of wisdom from a Christ-like figure who wants the best for everyone in America:  - “There is no separation of church and state. It’s a fabrication, it’s a fiction, it’s not in the constitution. It’s made up by secular humanists.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Jul 6, 2022     *Context: Kirk dismissed the constitutional principle of church–state separation, framing it as an invention of secular humanists.*    - “If you’re a WNBA, pot-smoking, Black lesbian, do you get treated better than a United States marine?” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Dec 8, 2022     *Context: He mocked Brittney Griner’s release from Russian custody, contrasting her with U.S. military personnel.*    - “I think it’s worth it to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the second amendment to protect our other God-given rights. That is a prudent deal. It is rational.” – TPUSA Faith event, Apr 5, 2023     *Context: At a Turning Point USA Faith event, he argued that recurring gun deaths are an acceptable trade-off to preserve Second Amendment rights.*    - “Happening all the time in urban America, prowling Blacks go around for fun to go target white people, that’s a fact. It’s happening more and more.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, May 19, 2023     *Context: Kirk described Black people as predatory and violent, pushing a racist stereotype about interracial crime.*    - “If we would have said that Joy Reid and Michelle Obama and Sheila Jackson Lee and Ketanji Brown Jackson were affirmative action picks, we would have been called racists. Now they’re coming out and they’re saying it for us … You do not have the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously. You had to go steal a white person’s slot to go be taken somewhat seriously.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Jul 13, 2023     *Context: He attacked Black women leaders, claiming they only advanced due to affirmative action and lacked intellectual ability.*    - “If I’m dealing with somebody in customer service who’s a moronic Black woman, I wonder is she there because of her excellence, or is she there because of affirmative action?” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Jan 3, 2024     *Context: Kirk questioned whether a Black woman in customer service was competent, or just a token hire under affirmative action.*    - “If I see a Black pilot, I’m going to be like, boy, I hope he’s qualified.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Jan 23, 2024     *Context: He implied Black professionals, including pilots, are suspect hires whose competence should be doubted.*    - “The great replacement strategy, which is well under way every single day in our southern border, is a strategy to replace white rural America with something different.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Mar 1, 2024     *Context: Kirk invoked the white nationalist “Great Replacement” conspiracy, claiming immigration is designed to displace white Americans.*    - “The American Democrat party hates this country. They wanna see it collapse. They love it when America becomes less white.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Mar 20, 2024     *Context: He accused Democrats of deliberately pushing demographic change to weaken America and reduce its white population.*    - “We need to have a Nuremberg-style trial for every gender-affirming clinic doctor. We need it immediately.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Apr 1, 2024     *Context: He compared gender-affirming care to war crimes, calling for doctors to face trials modeled on Nazi prosecutions.*    - “The answer is yes, the baby would be delivered.” – Surrounded debate show, Sep 8, 2024     *Context: Asked if he would allow his 10-year-old daughter to have an abortion if raped, Kirk replied no — the child would be forced to give birth.*    - “America has freedom of religion, of course, but we should be frank: large dedicated Islamic areas are a threat to America.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Apr 30, 2025     *Context: He framed Muslim communities as inherently dangerous, arguing they pose a national security threat.*    - “We’ve been warning about the rise of Islam on the show, to great amount of backlash. We don’t care, that’s what we do here. And we said that Islam is not compatible with western civilization.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Jun 24, 2025     *Context: Kirk declared Islam fundamentally incompatible with Western values and civilization.*    - “America was at its peak when we halted immigration for 40 years and we dropped our foreign-born percentage to its lowest level ever. We should be unafraid to do that.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Aug 22, 2025     *Context: He praised the early 20th-century era of immigration restriction and advocated for shutting down immigration again.*    - “Reject feminism. Submit to your husband, Taylor. You’re not in charge.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Aug 26, 2025     *Context: In response to news of Taylor Swift’s engagement to Travis Kelce, he told her to abandon feminism and obey her husband.*    - “Islam is the sword the left is using to slit the throat of America.” – Charlie Kirk social media post, Sep 8, 2025     *Context: On social media, he claimed Islam is being weaponized by the political left to destroy the United States.*;1
1nonj9g;I applaud her for this. The insistence that Charlie Kirk, a demagogue, bigot, and advocate for political violence, was worthy of being honored for what he did is nothing short of infuriating.;1
1nonj9g;"Sadly, the fact that so many Democrats voted ""Yes"" on this resolution shows how weak, unfocused and worthless the Democratic Party has become.  A corporate bag of spineless mush. There's no fight in these corporate Democrats.";1
