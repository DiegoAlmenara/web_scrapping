[The President](https://inews.co.uk/news/science/what-science-says-autism-why-trump-wrong-3932354?ico=in-line_link) highlighted “historic trade deals” with the UK and others, and claimed the US was respected “like it has never been respected before” – but the response was embarrassing.  There was [scattered awkward laughter in the room](https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/uk-politics-latest-updates-live-5-3930091?ico=in-line_link) as he jokingly complained about a broken escalator and teleprompter at the UN – and a lack of marble floors. UN officials and experts have warned that Trump’s combative approach to the organisation could lead to a waning of US influence.  Since the start of the year, Trump has moved to slash US funding of the UN, withdrawn from many of its agencies, and ordered a review of America’s interactions with the organisation.  His actions have exacerbated the UN’s already significant budget crisis and created space for nations including China to expand their influence.  “US credibility and influence as a reliable partner and as a state broadly committed to human rights and international peace and security is suffering badly,” Phil Lynch, executive director of the non-profit International Service for Human Rights, told *The i Paper*.  “Trump on the international level has an agenda which very much mirrors his agenda at the domestic level, which is one of the suppression of dissent, the erosion of accountability mechanisms and the subversion of the rule of law.  “His agenda at the UN in terms of the withdrawal of funding and denunciation of treaties follows a very similar pattern.”;1

politics;1nonj9g;Unlike other Dems, AOC refuses to join in whitewashing of Kirk;https://www.peoplesworld.org/article/unlike-other-dems-aoc-refuses-to-join-in-whitewashing-of-charlie-kirk/;Thank you AOC! Also, some words of wisdom from a Christ-like figure who wants the best for everyone in America:  - “There is no separation of church and state. It’s a fabrication, it’s a fiction, it’s not in the constitution. It’s made up by secular humanists.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Jul 6, 2022     *Context: Kirk dismissed the constitutional principle of church–state separation, framing it as an invention of secular humanists.*    - “If you’re a WNBA, pot-smoking, Black lesbian, do you get treated better than a United States marine?” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Dec 8, 2022     *Context: He mocked Brittney Griner’s release from Russian custody, contrasting her with U.S. military personnel.*    - “I think it’s worth it to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the second amendment to protect our other God-given rights. That is a prudent deal. It is rational.” – TPUSA Faith event, Apr 5, 2023     *Context: At a Turning Point USA Faith event, he argued that recurring gun deaths are an acceptable trade-off to preserve Second Amendment rights.*    - “Happening all the time in urban America, prowling Blacks go around for fun to go target white people, that’s a fact. It’s happening more and more.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, May 19, 2023     *Context: Kirk described Black people as predatory and violent, pushing a racist stereotype about interracial crime.*    - “If we would have said that Joy Reid and Michelle Obama and Sheila Jackson Lee and Ketanji Brown Jackson were affirmative action picks, we would have been called racists. Now they’re coming out and they’re saying it for us … You do not have the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously. You had to go steal a white person’s slot to go be taken somewhat seriously.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Jul 13, 2023     *Context: He attacked Black women leaders, claiming they only advanced due to affirmative action and lacked intellectual ability.*    - “If I’m dealing with somebody in customer service who’s a moronic Black woman, I wonder is she there because of her excellence, or is she there because of affirmative action?” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Jan 3, 2024     *Context: Kirk questioned whether a Black woman in customer service was competent, or just a token hire under affirmative action.*    - “If I see a Black pilot, I’m going to be like, boy, I hope he’s qualified.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Jan 23, 2024     *Context: He implied Black professionals, including pilots, are suspect hires whose competence should be doubted.*    - “The great replacement strategy, which is well under way every single day in our southern border, is a strategy to replace white rural America with something different.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Mar 1, 2024     *Context: Kirk invoked the white nationalist “Great Replacement” conspiracy, claiming immigration is designed to displace white Americans.*    - “The American Democrat party hates this country. They wanna see it collapse. They love it when America becomes less white.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Mar 20, 2024     *Context: He accused Democrats of deliberately pushing demographic change to weaken America and reduce its white population.*    - “We need to have a Nuremberg-style trial for every gender-affirming clinic doctor. We need it immediately.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Apr 1, 2024     *Context: He compared gender-affirming care to war crimes, calling for doctors to face trials modeled on Nazi prosecutions.*    - “The answer is yes, the baby would be delivered.” – Surrounded debate show, Sep 8, 2024     *Context: Asked if he would allow his 10-year-old daughter to have an abortion if raped, Kirk replied no — the child would be forced to give birth.*    - “America has freedom of religion, of course, but we should be frank: large dedicated Islamic areas are a threat to America.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Apr 30, 2025     *Context: He framed Muslim communities as inherently dangerous, arguing they pose a national security threat.*    - “We’ve been warning about the rise of Islam on the show, to great amount of backlash. We don’t care, that’s what we do here. And we said that Islam is not compatible with western civilization.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Jun 24, 2025     *Context: Kirk declared Islam fundamentally incompatible with Western values and civilization.*    - “America was at its peak when we halted immigration for 40 years and we dropped our foreign-born percentage to its lowest level ever. We should be unafraid to do that.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Aug 22, 2025     *Context: He praised the early 20th-century era of immigration restriction and advocated for shutting down immigration again.*    - “Reject feminism. Submit to your husband, Taylor. You’re not in charge.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Aug 26, 2025     *Context: In response to news of Taylor Swift’s engagement to Travis Kelce, he told her to abandon feminism and obey her husband.*    - “Islam is the sword the left is using to slit the throat of America.” – Charlie Kirk social media post, Sep 8, 2025     *Context: On social media, he claimed Islam is being weaponized by the political left to destroy the United States.*;1

Conspiracy theories are fun, regardless of whether they are accurate.  Trump tried to create his Reichstag fire with the LA demonstrations.  It failed.    As it turns out, the military and National Guard are not particularly eager to be involved, as we can see now in DC with the Guard members posing in tourist photos and picking up trash instead of shooting people as Trump would have hoped.;164

It’s spent through the budget process. The budget, as established in the “Big Beautiful Bill” is heavily weighted toward tax reduction for the very wealthy, reduces healthcare for millions and overspends income by about 4 trillion dollars. The tariffs make a minor contribution to the budget. The national debt increases by 4 trillion in spite of the tariffs. Effectively, the government borrows to cover tax cuts. The majority of the tariffs will be paid by US consumers and US companies. The companies will gradually raise prices to assure the majority of the cost will be passed on to consumers. We are all being screwed in the process.;376

PoliticalDiscussion;1nnpbbf;Why are American conservatives (Trump) so popular in Israel, whereas American Jews are predominantly Democrat?;https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1nnpbbf/why_are_american_conservatives_trump_so_popular/;American Jews as a demographic are mostly Ashkenazim, meaning their families came to the US from Eastern European countries. Jews in America have largely been a part of the Democratic coalition since the New Deal. Prominent left-wing Israeli politicians like Ben Gurion and Golda Meir were also Ashkenazi and coming from socialist countries in the USSR may have influenced that. American Jews are also highly educated (which correlates with voting left-wing in the US) and are concentrated in states like blue states like New York, Illinois, and California, and purple states like Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Florida.  The majority of Israeli Jews are Mizrahi, which means their family came to Israel from Middle Eastern/Arab countries (or have lived in Israel for several generations). These voters, who experienced living in Arab countries are much more security minded and have experienced/heard stories of the persecution of Jews in Arab lands. One of the reasons that Israel went from having socialist leadership early on like Ben Gurion and Golda Meir, to conservative leadership like Sharon and Netanyahu is that Israel's early immigrants were Ashkenazi and over decades the country grew from Jewish immigrants being kicked out of Muslim countries like Yemen, Iraq, Morroco and migrating to Israel.  Trump is popular in Israel because he is viewed as being unapologetically pro-Israel and pro-Israeli security. He recognized Israeli annexation of the Golan, moved the US embassy to Jerusalem (de-facto recognizing it as Israel's capitol), and has been supportive of the war against Hamas in Gaza (for example Trump negotiated directly with Hamas on the release of an American Israeli captive Edan Alexander). Jews in Israel, receive the benefits of Trump's foreign policy without having to endure his Domestic policy. American Jews are socially liberal, and while many are supportive of Israel, they are more affected by Domestic US policy and vote left for social/economic reasons (abortion is overwhelmingly accepted in Judaism for example).;1
PoliticalDiscussion;1nnpbbf;Why are American conservatives (Trump) so popular in Israel, whereas American Jews are predominantly Democrat?;https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1nnpbbf/why_are_american_conservatives_trump_so_popular/;1. Israel is a far-right society radicalized by decades of conflict. The Jews there grow up in that environment. The Jews here don't, if anything they grow up in very much the opposite of that environment here: peaceful progressive diverse cities like NYC. They haven't grown up in perpetual conflict. A demagogue like Trump is perfect for a country like Israel, Bibi himself is like an Israeli Trump.  2. American Jews can smell the Republican antisemitism from like a mile away. Israeli Jews live in a majority Jewish country where parties across the spectrum are dominated by Jews, they don't really have an issue with antisemitism in their politics, so they can vote as far-right as they want without having to fear antisemitism.;1
PoliticalDiscussion;1nnpbbf;Why are American conservatives (Trump) so popular in Israel, whereas American Jews are predominantly Democrat?;https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1nnpbbf/why_are_american_conservatives_trump_so_popular/;I think it should be mentioned the out sized political power Orthodox Jews world in Israel compared to elsewhere. They are very populous and yet don't have to serve in the military, afaik. They are in general much more in favor of military action than their Israeli counterparts, and yet have no stake in the game.;1
PoliticalDiscussion;1nnpbbf;Why are American conservatives (Trump) so popular in Israel, whereas American Jews are predominantly Democrat?;https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1nnpbbf/why_are_american_conservatives_trump_so_popular/;"The American Evangelican Christian Right has promoted Israel since the 1970s. The Modern Evangelical Movement is highly Millennialist meaning that its very apocalyptic in a very immediate sense. This strain of Christianity stresses that the end times are going to happen any time now, or that they've already begun and we are now living through their opening stages. This idea creates an immediacy to their faith, that they must get right with God right now *or else.* In their interpretation of the End Times Israel is central to everything that will signal the Anti-Christ and the 1000 years of darkness will occur! In the Jewish Bible *Israel* refers to the Jewish People in covenant with their God, and in the New Testament it refers to the People of God which is anyone who's Christian who's soul is saved. The Evangelical Right has identified the State of Israel, which identifies itself as the nation of the Jewish People, as being their biblical Israel.   So in a case of strange bed fellows many Evangelical Americans pushed for the US Government to become much more Pro-Israel and much more pro-active in supplying them weapons and regional support. They pushed really hard for about a decade for an American presidential candidate who was openly Pro-Christianity, Pro-""Family Values"", and importantly Pro-Israel. Haaaaaaaaaaaaave you met Ronald Reagan? The Reagan Administration leapt into partnering with Israel, even overlooking cases of Israeli espionage and industrial spying, treating it like another front in the global Cold War.   Donald Trump is the inheritor of the American Political Right's need to promote Israel for their End of Days prophecies to come true. The Evangelical Right was an early and enthusiastic adopter of Donald J Trump because he made early and enthusiastic overtures to their leaders, who promoted him as The Man who was going to save the soul of America, right all of the wrongs, and who would stand up for their brand of Christianity in a forceful and open manner. I doubt Trump himself, as a private individual, has much regard or interest in Israel. He's reportedly called Jewish People who've worked for him (or who he's butted heads with) some remarkably un-politically correct nick names. Before his Presidency he had no great affinity with the Jewish community of New York as far as I can tell.   But if he's to be the Defender of the Evangelical Christian Right and its cause, then promoting Israel and protecting it is of course what he's always been in favor of!";1

Somehow, the FCC chair at the time magically refrained from getting involved    Trump is a thin skinned baby and has filled his Administration with more of the same.   As for the FCC in general, their ability to have any influence on content should be wound down.. as should broadcast television in general.

I think a part of America died when an FCC official bullied a network into firing someone they disagreed with politically.  That is what happens in dictatorships and banana republics, not the greatest democracy the world has ever known.  I feel anger, shock, disbelief and betrayal. And I can't even trust my neighbors anymore. Everyone has gone stark raving mad and will do anything Trump says and defend him no matter what.  It is truly a cult.;51

worldnews;1noek1c;NATO Nation Ready To Shoot Down Russian Planes;https://www.newsweek.com/nato-nation-ready-shoot-down-russian-planes-10474064;Russia understands that NATO has professional air forces that, for the most part *side eye glance at turkey* won’t engage over a few minutes of airspace violation unless certain criteria are met. If they are glancing over the airspace we will communicate first, then trail. They know this. So they will stray over slightly and stay there long enough to send a message but short enough and in a location that wouldn’t warrant a shoot down. If MIGs started heading for Tallinn old town I would expect our escalation to be much swifter.  The shitty thing is, that for the distances involved over Finland and Estonia, we really do need to make a posture change and have a first 5 minute shoot down if they don’t respond. Russia uses the professionalism of our militaries against us, and it takes something like the shooting down in turkey or the battle of Khasham to send a message and stop it.;169

If separate drones were caught at military areas id imagine they would avoid publishing it too to avoid the public panicing (but is just my personal theory what may or may not be going on).   First they test harmless drones with lights on to test the antidrone readiness, then they use harmless drone with no ligths to check the detection rate and reaction speeds at night, then when so many places either gets absolutely innundated with drones i dare say it starts taking them down they change the strategy and either effs off completely (because it may as well be to distract or cause pure mayhem)or they scale up and arms them depending on how quickly nato countries are able to reinforce important infrastructure against drone attacks whether or not russia actually intends to fight nato, so personally leaning on scare tactics so NATO countries divert military spending and manpower to bolster selfdefence rather than send it to ukraine, so by pure numbers it would be easier for russia to attempt to push Ukraines limits.;555
